Hi! Thanks so much for looking at my project! This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript!
Inside there are 4 html pages. 
- index.html (home page)
- mountaininfo.html (mountain search)
- parksearch.html (filters and searches for national parks)
- mystery.html (an easter egg page!)

I hope you enjoy scrolling through this! Take care!
